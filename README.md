## Note

I'm going to move to the next version using inertia to help with vue js. Be aware that this version
is uncompleted, but at least I manage to use my knowledge of css and html to build and manage styling
and layout (with the help of tailwind). I'm going to rely heavily on pre-built components and designs in 
version 2. I'm not sure if I will come back on this version to complete the leftover tasks. We will see about that.
